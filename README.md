DISCLAIMER: This product uses the Census Bureau Data API but is not endorsed or certified by the Census Bureau.

To pull data from the Census API, it's recommended to request an API key (limited queries are available without one, but frequent queries require a key). You can make this request at [https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html).

Once you get your key, create a file called `.env` in the project root with the following line:
```
CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
