# NYC Community Clustering

Welcome! This project explores community structure across New York City using spatial clustering on demographic, housing, and economic data. This is an AI-generated template that I will fill in soon with my own words. 

## Motivation

Briefly explain why this project is interesting and relevant. For example, what insights you hoped to uncover about neighborhood clusters or urban demographics.

## Data & Methods

- **Data Sources:** Describe the datasets you used (e.g., census data, neighborhood boundaries).  
- **Methods:** High-level overview of your clustering approach, features, and any preprocessing. Keep it concise — avoid too many technical details here.

## Results

Summarize key findings:
- Number of clusters identified
- Notable patterns or trends
- Any interesting visualizations (consider embedding images with `![alt text](assets/figure.png)`)

## Conclusions

Highlight the takeaways from your analysis:
- What did the clustering reveal about NYC communities?  
- Any implications or next steps?
